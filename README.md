## Installing the extension:
To add the script to the game, you must have a userscript plugin. Some options include:
- [TamperMonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) (Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, Opera Next, Dolphin Browser, and Firefox)
- [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox)
- [ViolentMonkey](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/violent-monkey/) (Opera)
 
 After you have installed a userscript plugin, install the script, and you're ready to go!
